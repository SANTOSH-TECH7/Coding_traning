There are n-tiles(numbered from 0 to n-1). Each tile is made of the two squares. That are closed either red (Letter "R") and green(letter "G")
A title is described with two characters string representing the respective colours of the left and right squares. The tiles cannot be rotated
(which means "RG" and "GR" tiles are different). Two tiles can be placed next to each other if the color of their adjacent square is the 
same. What is the length of the longest possible squence that can be created using the provided tiles.

Write a function:
  int solution(char*A[], int N);

that given the array A of N strings reperesenting tiles, return the maximum number of tiles that can be arranged in the sequence.

Ex: A=["GR","RR", "GR", "RG", "GR", "GR","RR"]

to get the longest sequence we can select the tiles 0,2,3,4,5 and arrange in the sequence of 

   OUTPUT:    GR-RR-RG-GR-RR
